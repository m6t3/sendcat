SENDCAT

Sendcat is a small utility useful for sharing files in a local network.
It use netcat for tranfer files through wireless and cable network.
There are two flavours of sendcat, a command line version and one with a simple gui zenity-based.
The sintax for the cli version is:

sendcat filename

If the filename refer to a existing file the application is activate in send mode, otherwise sendcat go in listen mode and wait for the file that will be named with the choosen filename.
Sendcat is compatible with Ubuntu and other distro using upstart init, soon will be added support for systemd distros and hopefully android devices.
